# Welcome to Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI

This module serves as your gateway into the fascinating world where artificial intelligence meets physical embodiment. Whether you're a curious beginner or an enthusiast looking to expand your knowledge, this section is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the real world through a physical body, using sensors to perceive their environment and actuators to perform actions. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI systems such as humanoid robots face unique challenges and opportunities related to mechanics, perception, control, and real-time interaction.

In the upcoming lessons, we will explore:
*   **What is Physical AI**: Delve into the core definitions and distinctions of Physical AI from other forms of artificial intelligence.
*   **Understanding Embodied Intelligence**: Discover how the physical form of a robot influences its intelligence and learning capabilities.
*   **Sensors & Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals**: Learn about the essential components that enable robots to perceive their surroundings and the basic principles governing humanoid robot design.

This module culminates in a hands-on exercise where you'll get to explore a simple simulated humanoid robot environment. This practical experience will solidify your understanding of how these theoretical concepts translate into real-world (or simulated-world) applications. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the future of intelligent machines!
