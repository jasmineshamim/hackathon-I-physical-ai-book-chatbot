# Hardware & Lab Setup: Preparing Your Physical AI Workspace

Developing Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications extends beyond software; it deeply involves physical hardware. Whether you're working with a powerful workstation, an embedded device like an NVIDIA Jetson, or connecting various sensors and robotic components, a well-prepared hardware and lab environment is crucial for success. This section provides comprehensive guidance on setting up your workspace to effectively build, test, and deploy your Physical AI projects.

While much of your initial development and testing can occur in simulation (as explored in Module 3), eventually, you'll want to deploy your intelligent agents to physical hardware. This section prepares you for that transition, ensuring you have the right tools and setup to bridge the gap between virtual and real-world robotics.

In this section, we will cover:
*   **Workstation & GPU Requirements**: Understand the computational demands of Physical AI development and the recommended specifications for your development machine, especially concerning GPU acceleration.
*   **NVIDIA Jetson Setup Guide**: Learn how to set up and configure NVIDIA Jetson embedded platforms, which are popular choices for deploying AI models to edge robotics devices due to their powerful, energy-efficient GPUs.
*   **Connecting Sensors & Robot Hardware**: Get practical advice on interfacing various sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs) and actuators with your robot's control system, including common connection methods and troubleshooting tips.
*   **Cloud-based alternatives (Simulation + Training)**: Explore how cloud computing resources can complement or even substitute local hardware for computationally intensive tasks like large-scale simulation and AI model training.

This section culminates in a hands-on exercise where you'll deploy ROS 2 nodes from a PC to a Jetson device, giving you direct experience with cross-platform robotics development. A robust hardware setup is the foundation upon which truly intelligent physical systems are built.
